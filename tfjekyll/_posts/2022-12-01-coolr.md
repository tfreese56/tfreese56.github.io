For the company <img src="/img/beyondlogistics.png" alt="beyond logistics llc logo" class="bl-icon" onclick="window.location='https://beyondlogisticsllc.com'"/>, I wrote an Order Processing Management System. The program ingested invoices, parsed, and stored them.

Using the invoices, we generated reports we need that were taking too much time to do ourselves manually. The reports were generated by simply clicking a button. 

<img src="/img/timer.png" alt="timer icon" class="inline-icon"/> Our reports searched invoice data and generated time sensitive, decision making information. Doing this manually was taking too much time and we knew it could be done faster.

Thus, Coolr was successfully written. <img src="/img/confetti.gif" alt="confetti gif" class="inline-icon"/>

## Impact

#### TL;DR
<img src="/img/prize.png" alt="prize logo" class="inline-icon"/> Saved our daily routine 8 working hours. 

<img src="/img/prize.png" alt="prize logo" class="inline-icon"/> Errors reduced to around once or twice a month.

### Precious Time Saved
After comparing differences between before and after Coolr, we estimate this program saved our daily routine 8 working hours. This time saved was spent refining processes and gaining an understanding of other future improvements to the workflow.

We also gained more peace of mind knowing the technology had our backs reporting accurate info. Of course, it relied on us supplying the data. But once in, the difficult, laborious work was given to the computer. Which, can do it faster and with less error!

### Less Error
Using Coolr, we were able to reduce our true errors to about once or twice a month in the daily processes that took place. Errors included missing product or incomplete orders.

### Tracking Changes
Coolr was built to keep track of differences between saved invoices. The user was able to see the difference in two different invoices chronologically. Thus, making the necessary changes in the daily workflow easier to adjust to. Before, these changes weren't so obvious.

A historical chain of invoices was viewable for each invoice stored.

### Product Location
Coolr's final major feature was inventory location for each product. Working this into the system was a huge time saver per day. Instead of searching for product, we were able to go right to the product needed.

### Thanks
Thanks for taking time to read about Coolr!

Best.
