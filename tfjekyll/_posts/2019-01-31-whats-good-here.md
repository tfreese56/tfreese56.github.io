In 2019, I was selected to be part of a six student app development team. [Dr. Nathan Backman](https://www.bvu.edu/academics/faculty/nathan-backman) of [Buena Vista University](https://www.bvu.edu/) <img src="/img/beaver.png" alt="beaver logo" class="inline-icon"/> led this expedition. 

<img src="/img/space-needle.png" alt="space needle seattle" class="inline-icon"/> We traveled to Seattle, WA where we lived a startup life. The University rented us a house for 2.5 weeks and we were to live and breath Seattle.

In the couple weeks we lived there, we developed an app, traveled the city, hiked, and visited companies like Amazon, Google, Adobe, and Microsoft.

This was an experience of a life time!

### What's Good Here? App
Our app idea solved this: you walk into a restaurant and wonder What's Good Here? Especially if you've never been there before! Our idea was to crowd source reivews on food items and the restaurant as a whole. 

With the crowd generated reviews, a user can set parameters such as quality, price, and quantity of food and receive results nearest their location.

We even built a recommendation system. The system took what food the user had rated well and made recommendations on similar items close by.
