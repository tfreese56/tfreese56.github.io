In 2019, I was selected to be part of a six student app development team. [Dr. Nathan Backman](https://www.bvu.edu/academics/faculty/nathan-backman) of [Buena Vista University](https://www.bvu.edu/) <img src="/img/beaver.png" alt="beaver logo" class="inline-icon"/> led the team and expedition. 

<img src="/img/space-needle.png" alt="space needle seattle" class="inline-icon"/> We traveled to Seattle, WA where we lived a startup life. The team worked each day to develop and use our app, recording real data as we traversed the city. The app What's Good Here? is a crowd sourced restaurant and food rating app. We ate out nearly every day and each wrote reviews on What's Good Here?. Our reviews included 5 star rating scales, images, and a comment section.

In the couple weeks we lived there, we developed an app, traveled the city, hiked, and visited companies like Amazon, Google, Adobe, and Microsoft.

### What's Good Here? App
Our app idea solved this: you walk into a restaurant and wonder What's Good Here? Especially if you've never been there before! Our idea was to crowd source reivews on food items and the restaurant as a whole. 

With the crowd generated reviews, a user can set parameters such as quality, price, and quantity of food and receive results nearest their location.

We even built a recommendation system. The system took what food the user had rated well and made recommendations on similar items close by.

### The team
Our team consisted of two rising seniors, juniors, and sophomores. At the time, I was a rising sophomore. We all contributed a great amount to the success of this project.

## Thanks
I'm still very thankful to have been part of this awesome experience. 

Thanks for reading about it!

Best.
