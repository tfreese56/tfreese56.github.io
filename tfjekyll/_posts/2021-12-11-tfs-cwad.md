This project is an extension of my other project [File System](/c/2021/12/01/file-system.html). Encrypted File System encrypts meta data and file data before storage and erases by overwriting with zero bytes.

Programming language: <img src="/img/c.png" alt="c programming" class="inline-icon"/>

Library for cryptography: <img src="/img/openssl-small.png" alt="openssl logo" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;"/>

## Extending the File System
The Encrypted File System uses 32 byte keys generated with OpenSSL's random bytes. The algorithm used to encrypt the meta and file data is AES-256-GCM.

## Goals
My goals for adding cryptography to the File System were to:
* provide "disk level" encryption handled by the File System
* erase user data with 0's on unlink
* each file gets its own 32 byte key for encryption which is destroyed on unlink
* user can interact with the file system just like the original

My motivation to compelete this project (~ December 2021) was merely proof-of-concept for myself.

I enjoy stretching my skills and capabilities into the unknown to learn more.

## Testing
I used the same suite of tests written for the original File System and added extra crypto tests. Given I wanted the user interface to be no different than the regular file system, all tests should pass just like they did in the original File System.

## Success
What could the final product do differently than the original File System?

1. Each new file receives its own key, is encrypted as a whole, then written block by block. The file system now accounts for key storage in front of the file data. When a user wants to read a file, the file system decrypts the ciphertext and provides the plaintext.

1. At the front of the system, the meta data is now encrypted with a 32 byte key. On open/initialize, the meta data is decrypted and stored in memory. On close, it is re-encrypted and written to disk.

## Thanks
Thanks for your time reviewing my Encrypted File System project.

Best.
