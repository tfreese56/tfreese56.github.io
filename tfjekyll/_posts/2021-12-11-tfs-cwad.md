The [File System](/c/2021/12/01/file-system.html) but encrypts meta data and file data before storage and erases by overwriting with zero bytes.

Library for cryptography: <img src="/img/openssl-small.png" alt="openssl logo" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;"/>

## Extending the File System
The encrypting file system uses 32 byte keys generated with OpenSSL's random bytes. The algorithm used to encrypt the meta and file data is AES-256-GCM.

## Goals
My goals for adding cryptography to the File System was to:
* provide "disk level" encryption handled by the File System
* erase user data with 0's on unlink
* each file gets its own 32 byte key for encryption which is destroyed on unlink
* user can interact with the file system just like the original

My motivation to compelete this post-rewrite of the File System (~ December 2021) was merely proof-of-concept for myself.

I enjoy stretching my skills and capabilities into the unknown to learn more.

## Testing
I used the same suite of tests written for the original File System and added a few extra crypto tests. Given I wanted the user interface to be no different than the regular file system, all tests should pass just like they did in the original File System.

## Success
What could the final product do differently than the original File System?

1. Each new file received its own key, was encrypted as a whole, then written block by block. The file system now accounted for key storage in front of the file data. On read, the file system reread and decrypted the data to hand back the specified blocks of plaintext data.

1. At the front of the system, the meta data was now encrypted with a 32 byte key. On open/init, the meta data is decrypted and stored in memory. On close, it was re-encrypted and written to disk.

## Thanks
Thanks for your time reviewing my Encrypted File System project.

Best.
