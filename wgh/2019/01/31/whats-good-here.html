  <h1>What's Good Here?</h1>

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css" />

<p>In 2019, I was selected to be part of a six student app development team. <a href="https://www.bvu.edu/academics/faculty/nathan-backman">Dr. Nathan Backman</a> of <a href="https://www.bvu.edu/">Buena Vista University</a> <img src="/img/beaver.png" alt="beaver logo" class="inline-icon" /> led the team and expedition.</p>

<p><img src="/img/space-needle.png" alt="space needle seattle" class="inline-icon" /> We traveled to Seattle, WA where we lived a startup life. We worked each day to develop and use our app in the city recording real data.</p>

<p>What’s Good Here? is a crowd sourced restaurant and food rating app. We ate out nearly every day and wrote reviews on What’s Good Here?. Our reviews included 5 star rating scales, images, and a comment section.</p>

<p>In the couple weeks we lived there, we developed an app, traveled the city, hiked, and visited companies like Amazon, Google, Adobe, and Microsoft.</p>

<h3 id="whats-good-here-app">What’s Good Here? App</h3>
<p>Our app idea solved this: you walk into a restaurant and wonder What’s Good Here? Especially if you’ve never been there before! Our idea was to crowd source reivews on food items and the restaurant as a whole.</p>

<p>With the crowd generated reviews, a user can set parameters such as quality, price, and quantity of food and receive results nearest their location.</p>

<p>We even built a recommendation system. The system took what food the user had rated well and made recommendations on similar items close by.</p>

<h3 id="the-team">The team</h3>
<p>Our team consisted of two rising seniors, juniors, and sophomores. At the time, I was a rising sophomore. We all contributed a great amount to the success of this project.</p>
